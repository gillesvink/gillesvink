### Hi there, my name is Gilles Vink. I am a Pipeline TD from the Netherlands ðŸ‘‹

I really like to make even more possible, accessible and less time consuming in Visual Effects by developing efficient pipelines and by creating artist-friendly tools. One of the tools I made is the [MagicDefocus](http://github.com/gillesvink/MagicDefocus) Nuke node.

Please feel free to contact me via ðŸ“§ mail or LinkedIn :)
